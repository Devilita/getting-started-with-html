    <h1>Key Concepts</h1>
    <p> <b>The Web</b>
    <br>
    The Web consists of many servers that are connected to each other and talk using the Hyper-text transfer protocol (http). Browsers fetch the Hyper-text markup language document (HTML doc) and render it for display. Those HTML documents can contain plain text, images, links, videos, and many more items.
    </p>
    <p><b>HTML</b><br>
      Hyper-text markup language (HTML) is used to format pages. It can do so by using tag elements. An element in its most basic form consists of an opening tag, some content, and a closing tag. For example &lttag&gtcontent&lt/tag&gt.
    One needs to be careful as the computer will always do as told - even if there are mistakes in the code, which it will not notice.</p>
    <p><b>Containers</b>
      Next to inline tags that will format the text <em>in line</em>, there are block elements that create containers, like invisible boxes, <form>like this</form> for the content to reside in.

      No need to remember everything. Look it up like a pro. There is too much code out there and one will not use everything all the time.

    <p><b>Don't be shy - just try!</b><br>
      There are many useful resoures out there to help us get started with coding. Learning by doing will prove useful and give immediate feedback.For example, how to create  <a href="www.udacity.com">links</a> or include images. Here is the homemade picture proof:<br>
